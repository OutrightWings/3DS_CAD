# Todo:
* Use earclipping to generate tris instead of fan so concave shapes
* multi select verts
* add vertex, delete vertex button
* save data
* home menu, shows last model on home menu? home menu -> editor always starts new file -> load
* UV mapping editor
* sprite editor
* polish software theming
* help button
* double tap view button to get other side. top -> bottom etc
# Maybe:
* Rotate View buttons cause smooth rotation transition, pick good values
* export model
* camera mode? load multi models and scale them? -- how would textures work?
* vert handles depth draw with edges to look cleaner
